I wanted to create some visualizations to understand car sales and profits for each dealer from a dataset containing data from dealerships( CarSalesByModelDataset.xlsx)
I created visualizations for the following captured KPI metrics: Quantity Sold by Dealer ID, Profit by Date and Model, Profit by Year and Dealer ID, and Sum of Profits for one of the car models (Hudson cars) by Dealer ID (CarSalesByModelVisualizations.xlsx)
